VIP Example
===========

This repository holds a very basic project for demonstrating the use of [VIP](https://github.com/dradtke/VIP). The project itself is a simple hello world app written in C and compiled using gcc and make. When VIP is installed correctly (including local mimetype support), you should be able to open up gVim in this project's root directory by just double-clicking on "example.vip". Once it's open, you can compile it by pressing F11, clean it with Shift+F11, and run it with F12.

While this is a minimal project, this is about as complex as a .vip file needs to be in order to be useful. Feel free to use this as a template for your own projects; just modify the project name and compiler/target properties if necessary.
