To install vim projects as a separate filetype in Linux:
--------------------------------------------------------

- Copy vimproject-open to somewhere on your PATH

- Copy vimproject-open.desktop to /usr/share/applications
	(or ~/.local/share/applications to install for just one user)

- Install the mime type with this command:
	$ xdg-mime install vimproject-mime.xml

- Set the default application with this command:
	$ xdg-mime default vimproject-open.desktop application/vim-project

- You might also be able to change the icon with this command:
	$ xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 48 gvim.png x-application-vimproject
